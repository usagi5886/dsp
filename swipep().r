# ABOUT #
#########

# The following is a line-by-line translation from Matlab into R of Arturo Camacho's SWIPE' pitch estimation algorithm, hosted at the following URL:
# http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~acamacho/publications/swipep.m
# SWIPE' uses only the first and prime harmonics of the signal to estimate the pitch, which is then fine-tuned using parabolic interpolation with a resolution of 1 cent.

# The following is the published journal article documenting the SWIPE' algorithm:
#Camacho, A., & Harris, J.G, (2008). A sawtooth waveform inspired pitch estimator for speech and music. Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 124(3), 1638-1652.
#http://scitation.aip.org/content/asa/journal/jasa/124/3/10.1121/1.2951592

# This, in turn, was based off of an earlier implementation (SWIPE) in Camacho's dissertation:
# Camacho, A. (2007). SWIPE: A sawtooth waveform inspired pitch estimator for speech and music. Doctoral dissertation, University of Florida, Florida.
# Downloadable from Camacho's homepage: http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~acamacho/english/curriculum.html#publicaciones

# In systematic comparisons of F0 extraction algorithms (e.g. based on the EGG baseline data at http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/research/projects/fda/ ), SWIPE' performs equally as well as, if not better than, other available algorithms. See for example: 
# Evanini et al 2012: http://scitation.aip.org/content/asa/journal/poma/11/1/10.1121/1.3609833
# Tsanas et al 2014: http://scitation.aip.org/content/asa/journal/jasa/135/5/10.1121/1.4870484

# Note that SWIPE' has been implemented in C by Kyle Gorman for Linux and Mac, which is significantly faster than both Camacho's original Matlab code or this R implementation.
# For further information, see the following links:

# USAGE #
#########

#____________________________#
# --- [ Initialization ] --- #

# In order to run this function, swipep(), you must have the packages "e1071" and "signal" installed.

# If you are have Internet access while running your code, and if you have the "RCurl" package installed, you can easily have R read this script directly from GitHub with the following single of code:
# eval(parse(text = RCurl:::getURL("https://raw.github.com/usagi5886/dsp/master/swipep().r", followlocation=TRUE, cainfo=system.file("CurlSSL", "cacert.pem", package = "RCurl"))), envir=.GlobalEnv)

#___________________#
# --- [ Input ] --- #

# The only required arguments are a vector of samples of the signal (x) and the corresponding sampling rate (fs).
# Note that this function estimates F0 for the entire signal provided in the function 'x'.
# If it is desired that only a subset of the full time-range of that signal is analyzed, then the vector 'x' simply needs to be adjusted accordingly.

# In addition, several optional arguments can be specified for fine-tuning, namely plim, dt, dlog2p, dERBs, woverlap, and sTHR.
# If left unspecified, these optional arguments are left at their default values, which Camacho claims "have been found empirically to produce good results".
# See the beginning of the function definition for details about each of these arguments.

#____________________#
# --- [ Output ] --- #

# Returns an object of class 'data.frame' with three columns:
# 1) 'Time' = the times at which the pitch was estimated
# 2) 'Frequency' = the fundamental frequency estimate at that time point.
# 3) 'Strength' = the strength of the corresponding F0 estimate

# 'Frequency' will sometimes be NaN (e.g. if dERBs is set high), but every frame should have a 'Strength' value.

#_____________________#
# --- [ Example ] --- #

# (1)

# Specify full path to a WAV file on your computer.
# Then, using the 'load.wave()' function from the 'audio' package, read in the soundfile
# ------------------------------------------
#filename = "..."
#Wave = audio:::load.wave(filename)
#x = as.numeric(Wave)
#Fs = attributes(Wave)$rate
# ------------------------------------------
# Corresponding line from Camacho's example:
# [x,Fs] = wavread(filename)

# (2)

# Now estimate the pitch of this signal every 10 ms within the range 75-500 Hz using the default resolution (i.e., 48 steps per octave), sampling the spectrum every 1/20th of ERB, using a window overlap factor of 50%, and discarding samples with pitch strength lower than 0.2.
# ------------------------------------------
#F0 = swipep(x=x, fs=Fs, plim=c(75,500), dt=0.01, dlog2p=1/500, dERBs=1/20, woverlap=0.5, sTHR=0.2 ) # Left at default: dlog2p=1/48
# ------------------------------------------
# Corresponding line from Camacho's example:
# [p,t,s] = swipep(x,Fs,[75 500],0.01,[],1/20,0.5,0.2)

# (3)

# Finally, plot the pitch trace.
# ------------------------------------------
#plot(x=F0$Time,y=F0$Frequency, xlab="Time (ms)", ylab="Pitch (Hz)")
# ------------------------------------------
# Corresponding lines from Camacho's example:
# plot(1000*t,p)
# xlabel('Time (ms)')
# ylabel('Pitch (Hz)')

# The descriptions for the arguments below are adapted from Camacho's original script.

x,
# Vector of samples of the signal whose pitch is to be estimated
# In terms of R classes, this should be a numeric vector.

fs,
# The sampling frequency of the signal (in Hertz).

#if ~ exist( 'plim', 'var' ) || isempty(plim), plim = [30 5000]; end
# Pitch limits
# The pitch is searched within the range [PMIN PMAX] (in Hertz).
# Since the computational complexity is directly proportional to the number of octaves in the pitch search range, it is recommendable to restrict the search range to the expected range of pitch, if any.
# Default settings: PMIN = 30 Hz, PMAX = 5000 Hz
plim = c(30, 5000),

#if ~ exist( 'dt', 'var' ) || isempty(dt), dt = 0.001; end
# TimeStep # Size of time step (in seconds)
# The pitch of the signal is estimated every DT seconds.
# Default setting: DT = 0.001 s
dt=0.001,

#if ~ exist( 'dlog2p', 'var' ) || isempty(dlog2p), dlog2p = 1/48; end
# Frequency step size (Literally, delta/change in log2(pitch)), used to determine the candidates
# The pitch is searched with samples distributed every DLOG2P units on a base-2 logarithmic scale of Hertz.
# For better results, make DLOG2P as small as possible.
# However, take into account that the computational complexity of the algorithm is inversely proportional to DLOG2P.
# Default setting: DLOG2P = 1/48 (48 steps per octave)
dlog2p = 1/48,

#if ~ exist( 'dERBs', 'var' ) || isempty(dERBs), dERBs = 0.1; end
# Difference/timestep in ERBs
# The spectrum is sampled uniformly in the ERB scale with a step size of DERBS ERBs.
# For example, if you set this to 0.05 (i.e. 1/20), the spectrum will be sampled every 1/20th of an ERB.
# For better results, make DERBS as small as possible.
# However, take into account that the computational complexity of the algorithm is inversely proportional to DERBS.
# Default setting: DERBS = 0.1 ERBs
dERBs = 0.1,

#if ~ exist( 'woverlap', 'var' ) || isempty(woverlap)
#    woverlap = 0.5;
#elseif ...
#end
# Window overlap factor
# The spectrum is computed using a Hann window with an overlap WOVERLAP between 0 and 1.
# For example, if you set this to 0.5, the window overlap factor will be 50%
# For better results, make WOVERLAP as large as possible.
# However, take into account that the computational complexity of the algorithm is inversely proportional to 1-WOVERLAP.
# Default setting: WOVERLAP = 0.5
woverlap = 0.5,

#if ~ exist( 'sTHR', 'var' ) || isempty(sTHR), sTHR = -Inf; end
# Strength threshold
# Pitch estimates with a strength lower than sTHR are treated as undefined.
# For example, if you set this to 0.2, samples with pitch strength lower than 0.2 will be discarded.
# Default setting: sTHR = -Inf (hence nothing is discarded).
sTHR = -Inf
